<indent=7%><b>Faction Abbreviations:</b> Allows you to put common abbreviations for factions or traitors instead of manually doing a faction override. All abbreviations are in the <b>Faction Abbreviations</b> section.</indent>

<indent=7%><b>Only Detect Marked:</b> This makes roles not show up on the right unless you mark it with an asterisk (*).</indent>

<indent=7%><b>Show Faction Color:</b> Determines when a role shows the faction color or when it should just show white.</indent>

<indent=12%><size=75%><b>Always:</b> Roles always show their faction color and never show white.
<b>Only Marked:</b> Roles show their faction color when marked with an asterisk (*), otherwise they show white.
<b>Only Roles:</b> Roles show their faction color, alignments show white.

<indent=7%><b>Additional Notes:</b> Allows you to put text in [single brackets] and it will show in the playerlist, to the right of set roles.</indent>

<indent=7%><b>Additional Notes Color:</b> Determines the color of additional notes.</indent>

<indent=7%><b>Manual Locking/Unlocking:</b> Adds a lock button next to each player's (except yours) name that lets you manually lock or unlock their role.</indent>

<indent=7%><b>Additional Notes Style:</b> Accessible mid-game. Determines how additional notes will look on the playerlist. You still input additional notes with [single brackets], this only changes how it looks on the playerlist.</indent>

<indent=7%><b>Copy to Clipboard Mode:</b> Accessible mid-game. Determines how each player is separated when copying Player Notes to the clipboard.</indent>

<size=125%><b>General Information</b></size>
If a role is revealed by the game, such as by Admirer proposal, PM/Witch reveal, Mayor/Marsh/Pros reveal, teammates/yourself, etc. it will be locked.
You cannot change what role shows in the playerlist when the role is locked, but you can change the faction.
Using a manual override (use any role id, only faction id is checked) or with Faction Abbreviations, you can change the shown faction of a locked role.
If the <b>Manual Locking/Unlocking</b> setting is enabled, a lock button will appear next to each player's name (except yours) that allows you to manually lock and unlock roles. This is not recommended as there is a possibility you overwrite important information (such as a PM reveal or your own teammates) with this, but the option <i>is there</i>.

This mod adds a Send to Chat and a Copy to Clipboard button to your Player Notes. They do exactly what you should expect them to do.

<b>(Applies to BToS2 Only)</b>
If you are playing a game with Pandora's Box, all Coven and Apocalypse factions will be set to Pandora automatically.
If you are playing a game with Compliant Killers, all NK factions will be set to Compliance automatically.
<size=60%>The only way to avoid this and use a Coven/Apoc/NK faction is with a manual override (for example, "#Admirer coven" becomes Pandora, but [[#1,2]] will stay Coven),
but is there much reason to mention these factions with the specific modifiers on?</size>
